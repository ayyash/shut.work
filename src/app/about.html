			As all frameworks (or libraries if you may), this started from the necessity to control repeating patterns
			of design and coding. Naming CSS before css processors, was very crucial, maintaining them was not easy.
			Shut framework was conceived in around 2004.
			<strong>Yes. I am a procrastinator.</strong>
		</p>

		<h3 class="f3 spaced">The case against Bootstrap</h3>

		<p>Bootstrap provided developers with a stylehsheet that allows them to draw anything, in HTML. Literally
			anything. Developers can control paddings and margins, background colors, borders, and a lot more. This, was
			not ideal, because <strong>it took the responsibility of maintaining site style out of stylesheets, into
				HTML pages</strong>. It created chaos.</p>

		<p><strong>Naming in Bootstrap is data-driven</strong> (sometimes), meaning, "btn-danger" is not always used for
			"danger" related options. Making a distinctive different looking button is a design option. CSS is not
			supposed to describe data, rather style, or choice of style. (For example, box-red, or box-light).</p>

		<p><strong>Detailed styling, over-loads the outcome stylesheet</strong>. SHUT framework provides enough for
			designers to quickly prototype, but to add style, and look and feel, they should roll up their sleeves and
			get their hands dirty. The output stylesheet is always smaller, and if done right, more maintainable.
			Bootstrap is a black box, hard to control, or maintain, let alone customize.</p>

		<p>When Bootstrap came out, a lot of designers found refuge from obstrusive libraries (like Kendo UI), where they controlled the HTML, and let CSS be what it is good for; styling. Unfortunately, as the years went by, <strong>Bootstrap became yet another UI component library with an overloaded HTML hierarchy</strong>, and a huge CSS stylesheet to maintain. This lead to many derived libraries trying to control the output by simply wrapping it inside mroe black boxes! </p>
			
		<p>The main take against that is maintainability on large projects. <strong>If you do not get the same HTML you wrote as a developer, fixing style issues becomes a nightmare</strong>. That actually is why I do not buy into web components, just yet. </p>

		<h3 class="f3 spaced">SHUT is to prototype.</h3>

		<p>Shut framework was first built with one target in mind: <strong>I am a designer</strong>, who wants to create
			a quick prototype, that can be used later to develop real code. I do not want to throw it all away and start
			over (as we do with prototype apps), and I do not want to dig too deep into the engine to customize it (like
			in Bootstrap). I aslo want to own the HTML output.</p>

		<h3 class="f3 spaced">The case against prototyping apps</h3>
		<p>
			The first online prototyping app I used was <a href="https://invisionapp.com"
				target="_blank"><strong>InvisionApp</strong></a>. Great app. Today I use <a
				href="https://www.figma.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Figma</strong></a> as my design Adobe-alternative
			tool, basically for everything. Except prototyping.
		</p>

		<p>Knowing how to code myself, I admittedly never tried to dig deeper into those apps' ability to create code. I
			just didn't care enough.</p>

		<p>In addition to that, my fingers hurt after a couple of hours moving and clicking the mouse to align things on
			screen! Am I becoming the grumpy old neighbor?</p>

		<p>My argument: just as Bootstrap caters for developers who do not design, those apps cater for designers who do
			not develop. They may have some coding skills though. But if you know how to code like I do, you would feel
			absolutely limited by those apps. <strong>So if you know how to code, CODE your prototype</strong>.</p>

		<h3 class="f3 spaced">Developers are color-blind</h3>

		<p>My cynical comeback to developers trying to design something out of the box. Developers who do not design,
			should not be given the power Bootstrap gives, they will most definitely screw it up. Stopped counting the
			number of times I was asked to “clean up and fix” code that went out of control, that was built by
			Bootstrap.</p>

		<h3 class="f3 spaced">SHUT, the world between.</h3>

		<p>Somewhere between Figma, the awesome prototyping tool, and Bootstrap the awesome CSS framework, lies SHUT.

		<ul class="normal alist">
			<li>
				<strong>LESS based.</strong> Better documentation, easier, and simpler. Sorry SASS people, but nothing
				beats the simple “.small()” to include existing rules with no hassle.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Does not involve JavaScript,</strong> nor has any prebuilt components. JavaScript is reliant on
				framework used by developers, to have a CSS framework have an opinion about it, is obstrusive.

			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Mobile-first, responsive, and development-ready</strong>. I do not have to throw away my
				prototype code any more.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Unobtrusive.</strong> Beyond resetting and normalization, no HTML element is redefined.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Customizable.</strong> Colors, sizes, shadows, et. al., are defined in the LESS variables file.
				LESS functions are documented to allow every project to have its own extended values.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>RTL enabled.</strong> I speak Arabic.
			</li>
		</ul>
