			<h2 class="f2 spaced weight-light">Why SHUT</h2>

			<h3 class="f5 spaced">
				History:
			</h3>

			<p>
				As all frameworks, this started from the necessity to control repeating patterns of design and coding.
				Naming CSS before css processors, was very crucial, maintaining them was not easy. Shut framework was
				conceived in around 2004.
			</p>

			<h3 class="f5 spaced">
				The case against bootstrap.
			</h3>

			<p>
				Bootstrap provided developers with a stylehsheet that allows them to draw anything, in HTML. Literally
				anything. Developers can control paddings and margins, background colors, borders, and a lot more. This,
				was not ideal, because it took the responsibility of maintaining site style out of stylesheets, into
				HTML pages. It created chaos.
			</p>

			<p>
				Naming in Bootstrap is data-driven, meaning, "btn-danger" is not always used for "danger" related
				options. Making a distinctive different looking button is a design option. CSS is not to describe data,
				it is to describe style, or choice of style. (For example, box-red, or box-light).
			</p>

			<p>
				Detailed styling, overloads the outcome stylesheet. A framework should provide enough for designers to
				quickly prototype, but to add style, and look and feel, they should roll up their sleeves and get their
				hands dirty. The output stylesheet is always smaller, and if done right, more maintainable. (Bootstrap
				is a black box, hard to control.)
			</p>

			<h3 class="f5 spaced">
				SHUT is to prototype.
			</h3>

			<p>
				Shut framework was first built with one target in mind: I am a designer, who wants to create a quick
				prototype, than can be used later to develop real code. Designs dig me on this.
			</p>

			<h3 class="f5 spaced">
				The case against prototyping apps
			</h3>

			<p>
				The first online prototyping app I used was invisionapp. Great app. Today I use Figma as my design
				Adobe-alternative tool, basically for everything. Except prototyping.
			</p>

			<p>
				Knowing how to code myself, I admittedly never tried to dig deeper into those apps' ability to create
				code. I just didn't care enough.
			</p>

			<p>
				In addition to that, my fingers hurt after couple of hours moving and clicking the mouse to align things
				on screen! Am I becoming the grumpy old neighbor?
			</p>

			<p>
				My argument: just as Bootstrap caters for developers who do not design, those apps cater for designers
				who do not develop. They may have some coding skills though. But if you know how to code like I do, you
				would feel absolutely limited by those apps. So if you know how to code, CODE your prototype.
			</p>

			<h3 class="f5 spaced">
				Developers are color-blind
			</h3>

			<p>
				My cynical comeback to developers trying to design something out of the box. Developers who do not
				design, should not be given the power Bootstrap gives, they will most definitely screw it up.
			</p>

			<h3 class="f5 spaced">
				SHUT, the world between.
			</h3>

			<p>
				Somewhere between Figma, the awesome prototyping tool, and Bootstrap the awesome CSS framework, lies
				SHUT.
			</p>

			<p>
				SHUT is based on LESS (better documentation, easier, and simpler). SHUT does not involve Javascript, nor
				has any prebuilt components. JS is reliant on framework used, to have a CSS framework have an opinion
				about it, is intrusive.
			</p>

			<h3 class="f5 spaced">
				Why was it called SHUT?
			</h3>
			<p>
				Why not?
