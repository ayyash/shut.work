		<!-- <h2 class="spaced weight-light">Why SHUT</h2>
		<p>
			This framework probably was concieved sometime in 2004, where I needed a unified way to name styles, and build prototypes quickly when the only tool to prototype was Dreamweaver (that was the best, not the only). Before pre-pocessors, naming CSS was very crucial, and unifying the color schema was a task too heavy. With Sass and Less, naming styles became a bit different, it no longer is ".redbox" but rather ".contact-box" where a function of shared styles is called in the body, thus controlling all similar boxes via a single location. But then, that was not the best way.
		</p>
		<p>
			Bootstrap in the picture forced their way of naming styles back to the old way, .redbox. Which is more maintainable for sure, allows quick prototyping, and descriptive. Boostrap however do not restrict themselves to that naming convesion, you will run into "warn-box" for example. Unfortunately it is quite restrictive. A red box, cannot be blue, and a warn box cannot be used for success message.
		</p>
		<p>
			The inception of SHUT framework started in 2011, where I just wanted to have a framework, not to build the project, but  prototype it quickly. The idea was once you get to the general idea, you build your own styles. Designers would get me.
		</p>
		<p>
			The mantra of SHUT lies somewhere between Bootstrap and Figma (Zeplin, InivionApp, etc). Those tools allow you to prototype quickly disregarding CSS. Boostrap helps developers turn an ugly prototype into a semi pretty one (well, before half the web turned into Bootstrap mockups!).
		</p>
		<p>
			My argument against prototyping apps: If you know how to code, you should code. My argument against Bootstrap: if you know CSS, you should CSS. Shut is what I developed to code prototypes, and instead of throwing it away, build on top of it to produce the final product.
		</p>
		<p>That being said, if you are a bootstrap developer, you will not like this, it does not give you a p-1, pt-1, p-2, pt-2 (that is chaos, developers should never be given that power), this framework allows CSS developers to create more unified styles, across the site.</p>
		<p>
			The major elements SHUT framework builds are the ones needed to quickly mock a prototype (PS. I am not good with the mouse, alignment in Figma-like apps hurts my fingers). The grid system, the responsive layout, type, color, butons and listings. In additon to generic tables, a card, modal windows. 
		</p>
		<p>
			SHUT framework is built with LESS, because frankly it has better documentation. The idea is to minimize LESS, and rely more on CSS, so LESS is good enough for the job.
		</p>
		<p>
			SHUT framework does not involve Javascript, nor has any pre built component. Components are JS framework-reliant, it is quite intrusive to let a CSS framework have an opinion about it.
		</p>
		<p>
			Why was it called SHUT? why not?
